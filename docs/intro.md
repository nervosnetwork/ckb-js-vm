# CKB-JS-VM Introduction
This project enables developers to write smart contracts in JavaScript on CKB.
As we know, C and Rust can be used to write smart contracts on CKB. They can be
compiled into RISC-V binary instructions as smart contracts. JavaScript can be
run on virtual machines, depending on variable implementations. If these virtual
machines are ported to CKB, JavaScript can also be run on CKB.

[QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) is a famous JavaScript virtual machine
implementation by Fabrice Bellard. This project aims to port it to CKB, enabling
JavaScript capabilities in CKB programming.

## Basic 
The project is finally compiled into a single binary: ckb-js-vm which can be
found in `build` folder after executing:
```
make
```

This smart contract can be executed on ckb-vm directly. Without any arguments,
it reads code_hash/hash_type from `args` in Script. Then run the JavaScript code(JavaScript
source file or bytecode) in a cell denoted by code_hash/hash_type. Below is
the structure of the ckb-js-vm Script:

```
code_hash: <code hash of ckb-js-vm, 32 bytes>
hash_type: <hash type of ckb-js-vm, 1 byte>
args: <args, 2 bytes> <code hash of JavaScript code, 32 bytes> <hash type of JavaScript code, 1 byte>
```
Please note that the first 2 bytes in the args field are reserved for future use.

## Command Line Options Explained
Smart contracts on ckb-vm can receive arguments, similar to other Linux
executables. Depending on the provided arguments, ckb-js-vm behaves differently.
There are four command-line options supported by ckb-js-vm:
* -e
* -f
* -c
* -r

Thanks to the power of
`exec` or [spawn](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0046-syscalls-summary/0046-syscalls-summary.md),
ckb-js-vm can easily run with arguments.

When -e is provided, it can accept a string and evaluate it. This behavior is
identical to the -e option in the native qjs:
```
-e  --eval EXPR    evaluate EXPR
```
Below is an example about how to use it:
```
-e 'console.log("hello,world")'
```

As argument can be very long on ckb-vm(depending on stack size), a very long JavaScript
code can be executed via this method.

When `-f` is provided, it treats JavaScript code as a file system, rather than a
single JavaScript code file. JavaScript module is based on file system. See more
[Simple File System and JavaScript Module](./fs.md).

When `-c` is provided, See section below.

When `-r` is provided, it can read a local file via ckb-debugger, but this
functionality is intended for testing purposes only. It does not function in a
production environment. For additional examples, please refer to the `tests`
folder.

## Bytecode
When `-c` is provided, it can compile a JavaScript source file into JavaScript bytecode with
output as hexadecimal. Below is a recipe about how to compile JavaScript source file:
```shell
ckb-debugger --read-file hello.js --bin build/ckb-js-vm -- -c | awk '/Run result: 0/{exit} {print}' | xxd -r -p > hello.bc
```
It reads `hello.js` and then compiles the JavaScript source file into bytecode in hex
formatting. Then, using the power of `awk` and `xxd`, it can be converted into
binary. Finally, it is written as `hello.bc`.

`ckb-js-vm` can transparently run JavaScript bytecode or source files, which can also
be in file systems.

## Script
A ckb-js-vm script contains following data structure:

```
code_hash: <code_hash to ckb-js-vm cell>
hash_type: <hash_type>
args: <ckb-js-vm args, 2 bytes> <code_hash to JavaScript code cell, 32 bytes> <hash_type to JavaScript code cell, 1 byte> <JavaScript code args, variable length>
```

The tailing bytes are JavaScript code arguments which can be used by JavaScript.
Note: 2 bytes ckb-js-vm args are reserved for further use. 

## Performance
The JavaScript code implementation for a ["hello,
world"](../tests/examples/hello.js) costs an approximate expense of 2.9 M
cycles. The utilization of a
[SimpleUDT](../tests/ckb_js_tests/test_data/simple_udt.js) consumes around 5.1 M
cycles(3.4 M for bytecode), while the
[ckb-lua-vm](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-lua-vm) takes a cost of
roughly 2.0 M(1.3 M for bytecode) cycles.
